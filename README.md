# remotesensing-981921_DecisionTree
Here, to help ascertain the relationship between the spectral bands and the predictions, we present in this repository our decision tree modelsâ€™ structure in text form. This structure can be accessed via this GitHub link, with additional information regarding it. The model was constructed with training samples from different dates, collected at the riparian zone of the Parana river. The presented structure is from the pruned tree model, with a total of 394 leaves and 787 nodes.
